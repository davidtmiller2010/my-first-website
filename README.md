# My very first web page

Welcome!

## Project Discription
I created this website as part of the learning material for a course on Fullstack Web Development run by the Code Institute
The purpose of this project was to help the student get familiar with the different development tools and technologies used within the first few modules of the course. 
The project lists and links a webpage explaining the different development tools and technologies which are used throughout the course program.

The website can be found [here!](https://davidtmiller2010.github.io/my-first-website/index.html)
